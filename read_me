1. open preprocess.ipynb and chage test_folder_path to your test data folder path
2.run preprocess.ipynb
3.run get_slice_range.ipynb to get slice range of every ct case
4.run effb3a-inference.ipynb get effb3a model prediction
5.run get_embedding.ipynb get every slice embedding for lstm model and swin model
6.run lstm model.ipynb get lstm model prediction
7.get swin transformer prediction from swin_inference
8.run get_ECCV_pred_from_prob.ipynb get ECCV submission 
9.ECCV submission is on covid_pred
